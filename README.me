<p>Welcome, coders! :)</p>
<p>We have successfully completed the concepts and practice problems on <strong>if...else statements</strong> and <strong>if...else ladder</strong>. I hope you enjoyed solving them! Now, it's time to dive into our next topic in Control Flow: <strong>Loops</strong>.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Read the articles on <strong>while loop</strong> and <strong>for loop</strong> in the Control Flow module.</li>
    <li>Solve the problems in the "Standard Problems" article of the same module.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Loops can sometimes make you feel stuck, but the following tips can help you:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Decode the range of loops carefully:</strong> Ensure you identify the start and end points to avoid endless loops.</li>
    <li><strong>Update loop control variables:</strong> Make sure the loop variables are updated within the loop body to ensure termination.</li>
    <li><strong>Dry run your code:</strong> Always dry run your code with examples to understand its flow and correctness. This is a universal tip for all programming problems.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<h3>Problem 1: Sum of First and Last Digit</h3>
<p>Write a C++ program to input a number and find the sum of the first and last digit using a for loop.</p>
<pre><code>Input: num = 12345
Output: Sum of first and last digit = 6</code></pre>
<h3>Problem 2: Product of Digits</h3>
<p>Write a C++ program to input a number from the user and calculate the product of its digits.</p>
<pre><code>Input: num = 1234
Output: Product of digits: 24</code></pre>
<h3>Problem 3: Palindrome Check</h3>
<p>Write a C++ program to input a number from the user and check if the number is a palindrome using a loop.</p>
<pre><code>Input: num = 121
Output: 121 is a palindrome</code></pre>
<h3>Problem 4: Power of a Number</h3>
<p>Write a C++ program to find the power of a number using a for loop.</p>
<pre><code>Input: base = 2 exponent = 5
Output: 2 ^ 5 = 32</code></pre>
<h3>Problem 5: Fibonacci Series</h3>
<p>Write a C++ program to print the Fibonacci series up to <code>n</code> terms using a loop.</p>
<pre><code>Input: N = 10
Output: Fibonacci series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34</code></pre>
